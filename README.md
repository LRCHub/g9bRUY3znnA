(Uh-uh-uh-uh, uh-uh-uh-uh)
Boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom
(Uh-uh-uh-uh, uh-uh-uh)
(Uh-uh-uh-uh, uh-uh-uh-uh)
Boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom
(Uh-uh-uh-uh, uh-uh)
She got that boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom,
boom, boom
And now I make her room boom, boom, boom, boom,
boom, boom, boom
She told me: Come back soon, boom, boom, boom,
boom, boom, boom, boom
We on that boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom,
boom, boom, boom
Come get that boom
Boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom
Come get that boom
Boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom
Come get that
Tossin' her, like, it's a lot of
She took my whole enchilada
What you need, I got a lot of
Make her sing like: La-di-da-da (bitch)
On my mama, I ain't gonna stop until I'm rich
(rich)
Got that money on my body, and it's really rich
2K on my boots and now she tryna toss a bouquet
I drop two K from my suitcase and she goggle me
like Twoface
Saw that ass and I said: Touché
Fuck the Klan unless it's Wu-Tang
Fuck your man, he's just a pussy
Adderall inside her pussy
She got that boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom,
boom, boom
And now I make her room boom, boom, boom, boom,
boom, boom, boom
She told me: Come back soon, boom, boom, boom,
boom, boom, boom, boom
We on that boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom,
boom, boom, boom
Come get that boom
(Uh-uh-uh-uh, uh-uh-uh-uh)
Boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom
(Uh-uh-uh-uh, uh-uh-uh-uh)
Come get that boom
(Uh-uh-uh-uh, uh-uh-uh-uh)
Boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom
(Uh-uh-uh-uh, uh-uh-uh-uh)
Come get that boom
Clack, clack, clack, clack, she on my left
Yeah, and, ooh, I like that, that, that
Ja, ja, das ist gorda, huh
England, is she from Germany?
Said she like my accent, she ain't heard of me
play it right
And she'll be prim and neat
Baby no Euro, that's foreign currency
Pop that on the spot like boom
Shawty say she wanna boom
When I boom, then you boom
Baby, make it boom, boom
Get up out the way like boom
Let me hear you say it, boom
When I boom, then you boom
She got that boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom,
boom, boom
And now I make her room boom, boom, boom, boom,
boom, boom, boom
She told me: Come back soon, boom, boom, boom,
boom, boom, boom, boom
We on that boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom,
boom, boom, boom
Come get that boom
(Uh-uh-uh-uh, uh-uh-uh-uh)
Boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom
(Uh-uh-uh-uh, uh-uh-uh-uh)
Come get that boom
(Uh-uh-uh-uh, uh-uh-uh-uh)
Boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom
(Uh-uh-uh-uh, uh-uh-uh-uh)
Come get that
